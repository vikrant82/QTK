# QTK Roadmap

> Phase-by-phase plan. Each phase is independently shippable — earlier
> phases must work alone before later ones become useful.

---

## Phase 0 — Repo bootstrap (✅ done)

- Brief, README, ARCHITECTURE, RTK-COMPARISON, SECURITY, ROADMAP docs
- Monorepo skeleton with `packages/{qtk-plugin, qtk-filters, qtk-core, qtk-dashboard}`
- Workspace `package.json`, gitignore, opencodeignore, license

---

## Phase 1 — TS-only MVP plugin (✅ done)

Working `qtk-plugin` that:

- Hooks `tool.execute.after` and compresses outputs
- Ships **11 production-quality compressors**:
  - `git status`, `git log`
  - `ls -la`
  - `find` / `fd`
  - `rg <pattern>` / `grep -r`
  - `npm` / `pnpm` / `bun` / `yarn` output
  - `cargo test` failures-only
  - `pytest` failures-only
  - **`Read` tool** (200+ line files → outline)
  - **`Grep` tool** (10+ files → grouped)
  - **`Glob` tool** (50+ paths → clustered)
- Session dedup cache that catches identical-output repeated calls
- Tee fallback to `.opencode/qtk-tee/` with strict 0o600 perms
- SQLite stats tracker
- Circuit breaker on compressor failures
- Plugin loads cleanly into opencode via `file://.opencode/plugin/qtk/`

### Deliverables — all shipped

- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/index.ts` — plugin entry point
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/{types,registry,config,cache,tee,stats,estimator,circuit-breaker}.ts`
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/compressors/{git,ls,find,rg,package-manager,cargo,pytest}.ts`
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/tools/{read,grep,glob}.ts`
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/test/compressors.test.ts` — 51 compressor tests
- [x] `scripts/install-into-opencode.ts` — symlink + jsonc edit + smoke test
- [x] `scripts/benchmark.ts` — measure compression ratios and p50/p90/p99 latency
- [x] `qtk gain` CLI — prints session-totals summary

### Acceptance criteria — met

- ✅ Plugin loads with no errors or warnings
- ✅ Compressors achieve ≥ 60% reduction on the fixture corpus
- ✅ Median additional latency per tool call: well under 5 ms (most under 100µs)
- ✅ p99 additional latency: well under 20 ms (max ~1.2 ms on real cases)
- 🟡 Real 30-minute session token reduction: needs live install measurement
- ✅ All compressors handle empty / huge / binary input without crashing
- ✅ Forcing a compressor to throw causes fallback to original output
- ✅ All tee files written are mode 0o600, owned by user only
- ✅ `qtk-stats.sqlite` created on first compression with proper schema

---

## Phase 2 — TOML filter DSL + RTK filter import (✅ done)

Goal: let users add per-project compressors without writing TypeScript.

### Deliverables — all shipped

- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/dsl/parser.ts` — hand-written TOML parser
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/dsl/spec.ts` — spec validator + regex compilation
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/dsl/runtime.ts` — compileFilter(spec) → Compressor
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/dsl/loader.ts` — scans project filters and packaged imported filters
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/dsl/watcher.ts` — hot-reload via fs.watch + 250 ms debounce
- [x] Registry: `prepend()` + `replaceUserCompressors()` for DSL integration
- [x] `scripts/import-rtk-filters.ts` — local-checkout import (no network code) with attribution
- [x] Documentation: `docs/FILTER-DSL.md` — full reference of supported keys
- [x] Tests: 39 DSL tests added (parser, spec, runtime, loader, end-to-end)

### Acceptance criteria — met

- ✅ A user can drop a new TOML file into `.opencode/qtk/filters/` and see the
  next matching tool call get compressed without restarting opencode
- ✅ Packaged RTK-compatible filters load by default; project filters take
  precedence and remain hot-reloaded
- ✅ Invalid TOML files log a warning but don't break QTK
- ✅ The DSL runtime achieves competitive performance — 98.2% reduction on
  `kubectl get pods` at p99 1.17 ms, same ballpark as hand-written TS
- ✅ RTK filter import: 59 filters are imported under
  `packages/qtk-filters/imported/`
- ✅ Packaged imported filters are copied into the plugin package at build time
  and loaded automatically unless `[qtk.filters].bundled = false`

---

## Phase 3 — Rust sidecar `qtk-core` (✅ done)

Goal: handle heavy parsers (XML, JSON, YAML, terraform plan) where Rust
regex + streaming parsers are materially faster and more memory-safe than
JS regex.

### Deliverables — all shipped

- [x] `packages/qtk-core/Cargo.toml` + `src/main.rs` — Rust binary reading
      NDJSON on stdin, writing NDJSON on stdout
- [x] `packages/qtk-core/src/parsers/{junit,terraform,kubectl,cargo_json}.rs`
      — four heavy parsers
- [x] `packages/qtk-core/src/protocol.rs` — wire format types (serde)
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/sidecar/client.ts` — long-lived subprocess
      client: spawn, NDJSON in/out, per-request promise correlation by id,
      health-check, auto-restart up to maxRestarts, then permanently disable
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/sidecar/locator.ts` — finds the qtk-core
      binary (env var, bundled, dev-checkout, PATH)
- [x] `packages/qtk-plugin/src/sidecar/compressors.ts` — async-Compressor
      wrappers that match shell commands and route through the client
- [x] Plugin integration: sidecar runs BEFORE the sync registry; if it's
      unavailable, the sync TS compressors run as normal
- [x] Tests:
  - Rust: 22 unit tests in `packages/qtk-core/src/parsers/*.rs`
  - TS: 10 integration tests that spawn the real binary
        (`packages/qtk-plugin/test/sidecar.test.ts`)
- [x] `scripts/benchmark-sidecar.ts` — cold-start latency + throughput
      benchmark
- [x] `unsafe_code = "deny"` enforced in Cargo.toml

### Acceptance criteria — exceeded

| Criterion                                | Target          | Actual                |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Cold start (spawn → hello → first call)  | ≤ 30 ms         | **2.4–6.7 ms**        |
| Throughput (serial, one client)          | ≥ 5,000 ops/s   | **7.7k–13.7k ops/s**  |
| Throughput (concurrent batches)          | bonus           | **10.5k–33k ops/s**   |
| Compression ratios on heavy parsers      | "materially better" | **63.5–97.3% saved** |
| Graceful degradation if binary missing   | required        | ✅ falls back to TS    |
| Auto-restart on subprocess crash         | required        | ✅ up to 3× then disabled |
| Compressor list reported via hello msg   | required        | ✅                     |

### What's NOT done in Phase 3

- ⬜ Bundle the binary into a Tauri externalBin (Phase 4 territory)
- ⬜ npm-distribution path (would need a postinstall script that downloads the
  right binary per OS — out of scope for now; we ship as a Cargo build)

---

## Public release — GitHub + qalarc.com + blog (🟡 in flight)

Before any code-level Phase 4 work, surface the project publicly.

### Deliverables

- [x] Sanitize repo of personal/private references
- [x] Push to `github.com/qalarc/QTK` (org transferred from fivelidz/QTK on 2026-05-26)
- [x] Add project card to `qalarc.com/projects/` (projects.json entry, featured)
- [x] Write a layman + technical blog post pair for qalarc-blog
- [x] Tag a `v0.3.0` release matching the Phase 3 cutpoint
- [x] GitHub Actions CI (3 jobs: TS, Rust, integration) all passing
- [x] GitHub Actions release pipeline cross-builds x86_64/aarch64 linux/macos
- [x] Bulk-import all 59 RTK filters
- [x] Community files (issue/PR templates, FUNDING.yml, SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- [x] npm-publishable scaffolding (npm pack --dry-run = 70KB tarball)
- [ ] Actually `npm publish` once npmjs.com `@qalarc` scope is registered
- [ ] Tag `v0.3.1` to verify release pipeline produces prebuilt binaries
- [ ] Post the RTK community outreach note (draft in `docs/RTK-OUTREACH-DRAFT.md`)

### Acceptance criteria

- A first-time visitor can read the README and understand:
  - What QTK is
  - Why it exists (the RTK comparison)
  - How to install it (3-step quickstart)
  - Concrete savings numbers from the benchmark suite
- The blog post pair (layman + technical) explains:
  - "Why am I paying for the same `git status` 50 times this session?"
  - The deterministic-compression thesis, with measured savings
  - The Rust-sidecar design with cold-start + throughput numbers

---

## Phase 4 — gmux/Tauri dashboard widget (🟡 partial)

A live UI showing what QTK is doing.

### What's already shipped (data plumbing)

- ✅ QTK writes `<project>/.opencode/qtk-savings.json` every 10s (debounced,
  atomic, mode 0o644) — `packages/qtk-plugin/src/savings-export.ts`
- ✅ Pricing module covers Claude, GPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, local models
  — `packages/qtk-plugin/src/pricing.ts`
- ✅ gmux tmux status bar: `format_qtk_widget()` in
  `gmux/src/status/pane_status.py` renders `⊟ 855.7k $2.57`, deduped by port
- ✅ gmux phone PWA: per-agent card shows `⊟ QTK saved 217k tok · $0.65 (283 calls)`
- ✅ gmuxtest Tauri UI: perf strip cell + per-pane HW row + pane footer badge
- ✅ `qtk gain --model=<id>` CLI emits USD-saved columns + daily/monthly/yearly
  extrapolation

### What's left for "full Phase 4"

- [ ] **Drill-down inspector modal** (gmuxtest Tauri UI): click a pane's
      QTK badge → modal showing the last N compressions for that pane with
      raw/compressed side-by-side diff. Data already exists via the tee
      files at `.opencode/qtk-tee/<call-id>.log`.
- [ ] **Real-time push from plugin** (vs polling JSON): currently gmux polls
      the sidecar file every 5s. Better: the QTK plugin emits an SSE event
      or writes to a Unix socket that gmux/Tauri subscribes to. This drops
      the 5s render lag to ~30ms but adds complexity.
- [ ] **Per-project + per-session history view**: cumulative tokens-saved
      sparkline chart, "top 10 most-compressed commands this session"
      table, model-cost breakdown by provider.
- [ ] **"What got compressed?" filter UI**: search/sort the
      `qtk-stats.sqlite` rows from inside the dashboard.

### Acceptance criteria

- Widget renders in real-time as the agent runs (< 500 ms after each call)
- No measurable impact on agent latency from event emission
- Works in both `gmux` (current target) and a future standalone QTK
  desktop app if built

---

## Phase 5 — Smart compaction integration (⬜ planned, target: 3 days)

Two parts: an upstream PR to opencode and a parallel patch to qalcode2
(our private opencode fork). Both end-states are: when the rolling-window
pruner kicks in, dropped tool outputs become summaries rather than `null`s.

Replace opencode's "[output pruned]" with "[summarised: 4 prior git status
calls, no changes since 14:18]" when the rolling-window pruner kicks in.

### Deliverables — upstream opencode (sst/opencode)

- [ ] **Issue first**: open `sst/opencode` issue describing the
      "compaction summarises rather than nulls" idea, get maintainer
      signal before writing the patch. Reference QTK's existing
      `qtk-stats.sqlite` as the data source the summariser would use.
- [ ] Patch to `packages/opencode/src/session/compaction.ts`
- [ ] Define a stable `Plugin.summariseOldOutput?(toolCalls)` hook in
      `@opencode-ai/plugin` so QTK (and any other plugin) can provide
      summaries
- [ ] qtk-plugin exposes a `summariseOldOutput(toolCalls)` function
      that compaction calls
- [ ] One LLM call per compaction event to generate the human-readable
      summary (we accept the small token cost in exchange for retaining
      meaningful context)
- [ ] Configurable: which compaction strategy to use — "null" (existing),
      "summarise" (LLM), or "deterministic-summarise" (template-based,
      no LLM)
- [ ] Tests + a `qtk` opt-in flag so users on stock opencode can try the
      feature without QTK being installed

### Deliverables — qalcode2 (our private opencode fork)

We ship to qalcode2 first as a proof of concept, then upstream to
opencode once we know it works. This decouples the QTK roadmap from
sst/opencode review velocity.

- [ ] Cherry-pick the compaction.ts patch into qalcode2's
      `packages/opencode/src/session/compaction.ts`
- [ ] Wire the new `Plugin.summariseOldOutput?` hook into qalcode2's
      plugin loader (independent of upstream until merged)
- [ ] Test in a real 4-hour qalcode2 session, capture before/after
      token budgets, compare "context retained" subjectively (does the
      agent still answer questions about what happened earlier?)
- [ ] If the qalcode2 experiment succeeds, file the upstream
      sst/opencode PR with measured data attached
- [ ] If we land upstream eventually, remove the qalcode2-local patch
      so we re-converge with stock opencode

### Acceptance criteria

- After a compaction event, the LLM can still answer "what was the git
  status earlier in this session?" accurately, based on the summary
- Compaction cost ≤ 200 tokens per event (whether template or LLM)
- Total context retained after compaction grows by ≤ 5% vs nulling
  (because we're adding summaries; trade-off is the model retains useful
  state)
- The upstream sst/opencode PR receives an "accepted in principle"
  maintainer comment, even if we end up iterating on the design
  before merge

---

## Phase 6 — Cross-agent extraction (⬜ maybe never)

If QTK turns out to be valuable beyond opencode, extract the core
compressor library to be agent-agnostic. Then write adapters:

- Claude Code (PreToolUse hook)
- Cursor
- Gemini CLI
- Generic shell wrapper

This is RTK's territory. We'd only do it if there's clear demand and our
architecture genuinely makes sense outside opencode — which is not
obvious. RTK already exists for this need.

**Phase 6 is more of a maybe than a plan.** Don't count on it.

---

- [ ] Publish `@qalarc/qtk-plugin` to npm under MIT license
- [ ] Announce on the opencode community channels
- [ ] Submit PR to opencode docs adding a "QTK" section

---

## What we're NOT doing

To keep the project scoped:

- **No general-purpose CLI proxy.** RTK already exists.
- **No Windows-specific code paths.** opencode runs on Linux/macOS.
- **No paid tier, no SaaS, no telemetry endpoint.** Local-only forever.
- **No automatic filter updates from a central repo.** Filters live in the
  user's project. No silent updates.
- **No LLM-based compression in the hot path.** The whole thesis is that
  this is unnecessary. Compaction summarisation is Phase 5 only.
- **No GUI installer.** Symlink + JSONC edit. That's the install.
- **No network code in qtk-core.** The Rust sidecar has zero HTTP deps;
  it only ever reads stdin and writes stdout.

## Decision log

Tracking design decisions and their justifications.

| Date       | Decision                                                    | Justification                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026-05-20 | Compress on `tool.execute.after`, not `tool.execute.before` | See ARCHITECTURE.md §1 — output-side compression covers all tools, zero prompt overhead, no double-wrap risk |
| 2026-05-20 | TypeScript Phase 1, Rust sidecar Phase 3                    | In-process JS wins on latency despite slower regex; Rust only for genuinely expensive parsers                |
| 2026-05-20 | No network code, ever                                       | Strongest possible privacy story, removes entire class of risks                                              |
| 2026-05-20 | Tee files 0o600, dir 0o700, no env override                 | Direct response to RTK audit findings §3.1 and §3.2                                                          |
| 2026-05-20 | Session cache is in-memory only in Phase 1                  | Simpler, faster; per-project persistence comes in Phase 2 if useful                                          |
| 2026-05-20 | Adopt RTK's TOML DSL format                                 | Apache 2.0 → MIT compatible; we get 100 filters for free                                                     |
| 2026-05-20 | Phase 5 (smart compaction) is its own phase                 | Requires upstream PR to opencode compaction code; landing that is a separate political/technical project     |
| 2026-05-26 | NDJSON protocol over stdin/stdout for qtk-core              | Trivial wire format; no JSON-RPC library needed; works with any subprocess-spawning host                     |
| 2026-05-26 | Sidecar is OPTIONAL, never required                         | Binary may not be available (no Rust toolchain, no prebuilt for arch); plugin must work as TS-only           |
| 2026-05-26 | Reframe public release as `opencode` plugin, not qalcode2   | qalcode2 is our private fork; the plugin actually works on any opencode-compatible host                      |
